# Test Report

Output from the tests run from ```npm start``` is generated by mochawesome upon the completion of all tests. This report, once generated, can be found at path ```./mochawesome-report/mochawesome.html``` displaying timing information and pass/fail status of each test.

## Bugs

* User can submit task with 0 hours worked
* User can submit task with more than 24 hours worked
* Overworked tasks are not coloured green
* Found in firefox (though may apply in other browsers) when adding a new task when tasks already in filter list only the first row is highlighted. All other rows, regardless of over preferred are white.

Not a bug though I was unable to login using the provided user/manager/admin roles and as such pre-condition data was considered missing. Instead, I created a user with the default user role of "user" and conducted tests using this account.

## Improvements

* Error state provided to user when hours worked is less than 0 or more than 24 prompting the user to enter a valid date.
* Minor UI usability when editing a task and user wishes to add a new task that they must follow a positive path of "saving" the current task before the interface allows the addition of a new task.
